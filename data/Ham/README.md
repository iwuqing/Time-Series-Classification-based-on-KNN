# Ham

Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. The ham data include measurements from 19 Spanish and 18 French dry-cured hams. Triplicate lanes of duplicate extractions (giving ~6 data vectors per sample), pre-processed and aligned as described in [1] and [2].
