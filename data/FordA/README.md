# FordA

This data was originally used in a competition in the 2008 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. The classification problem is to diagnose whether a certain symptom exists or not in an automotive subsystem. Each case consists of 500 measurements of engine noise. 

There are two separate problems: For *FordA*, both the train and test data were collected in typical operating conditions with minimal noise contamination. For *FordB*, the train data were collected in typical operating conditions, but the test data were collected under noisy conditions.

Train size: 3601

Test size: 1320

Missing value: No

Number of classses: 2

Time series length: 500
