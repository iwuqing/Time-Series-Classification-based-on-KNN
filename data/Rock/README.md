# Rock dataset

The data contain 70 rock examples from the ASTER spectral library [1]. Each series is rock spectral reflectance as a function of wavelength in micron, not time.

Classes correspond to type of rocks.

- Class 1: marfic 
- Class 2: quartzite
- Class 3: marble 
- Class 4: schist 

Train size: 20

Test size: 50

Missing value: No

Number of classses: 4

Time series length: 2844

There is nothing to infer from the order of examples in the train and test set.
